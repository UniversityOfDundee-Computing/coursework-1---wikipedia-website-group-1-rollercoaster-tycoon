        <h1>About</h1><br>RollerCoaster Tycoon is a series of simulation video games about building and managing
        an amusement park. Each game in the series challenges players with open-ended amusement park management and
        development, and allowing players to construct and customize their own unique roller coasters and other thrill
        rides.

        The first game was created by Scottish programmer Chris Sawyer, with assistance from various leading figures
        from
        the real-world roller coaster and theme park industry.[1] The rest of the series contains three other main
        games,
        expansion packs, a number of ports, and a mobile installment. A refresh of the series, RollerCoaster Tycoon
        World,
        was released in November 2016, and followed up by RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures for Switch in 2018 and PC in
        2019.

        Licensing for the series is currently held by Atari SA, who renewed their deal with Chris Sawyer on October 11,
        2022
        for ten more years.</p>

        <p class="card-text">RollerCoaster Tycoon was released for Microsoft Windows on 22 March 1999. RollerCoaster
          Tycoon was later ported to the Xbox game console in 2003. The game was developed by Chris Sawyer and published
          by Hasbro Interactive under the MicroProse brand.

          RollerCoaster Tycoon received two expansion packs: Added Attractions (released in North America as Corkscrew
          Follies) in 1999, and Loopy Landscapes in 2000. Two special editions were released: RollerCoaster Tycoon
          Gold/Totally RollerCoaster in 2002, which contained the original game, Corkscrew Follies, and Loopy
          Landscapes;
          and RollerCoaster Tycoon Deluxe in 2003, which contained the content in Gold plus more designs for the
          different
          customizable rides.

          A port for the Xbox was released on 23 March 2003, handled by Frontier Developments and published by
          Infogrames
          Interactive. This version featured both expansion packs as well.</p>

            <p class="card-text">RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was released on October 15th 2002. The game was developed by
              Chris Sawyer and published by Infogrames Interactive.
                <br>
              RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 has two official expansion packs: Wacky Worlds and Time Twister, both released in
              2003 and had no involvement from Chris Sawyer, instead being handled by Frontier Developments. The Combo
              Park Pack edition contains the original game and the Wacky Worlds expansion. The Triple Thrill Pack
              contains the original game and both expansions.<br>

              In April 2014, an open-source project, known as OpenRCT2, was launched to enhance the gameplay of
              RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, including fixing bugs and allowing the game to run natively on macOS, Linux and
              modern Windows. The game is completely re-written in the C++ programming language, but still relies on
              assets from the original game. OpenRCT2 reduces limitations in the original, and adds other completely new
              features such as multiplayer.[3]</p>

            <p class="card-text">RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 was released on November 2nd 2004 in North America. Although the
              core features of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 are based on the previous games, Chris Sawyer, the developer of
              the first two games, acted only as a consultant. The game was developed by Frontier Developments instead,
              and published and advertised by Atari Interactive featuring a completely different structure.<br>

              Two expansion packs for RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 were released - Soaked! and Wild!. A bundle, RollerCoaster
              Tycoon 3 Gold, was also released, including the original game and the Soaked! expansion pack; this was
              followed by RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum (Deluxe for the EU version of the game), including both
              expansion packs and the original game. RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum was released for Windows and Mac OS
              X.<br>

              A remastered version of the game titled RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition, developed and published
              by Frontier Foundry, was released for Windows, macOS, and Nintendo Switch, featuring widescreen support
              and revamped controls to accommodate for Switch features.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">RollerCoaster Tycoon World</h5>
            <p class="card-text">RollerCoaster Tycoon World was developed by Nvizzio Creations for Atari Interactive and
              RCTO Productions and released on 16 November 2016. The installment is different from previous games in
              that players build coasters with a spline-based system. It also introduced a new "Architect mode" and
              "safety-rating" options when building coasters. The game is also the first to incorporate the Steam
              Workshop.<br>

              The game received largely negative reviews, both from critics and fans of the franchise, particularly
              compared to Planet Coaster, which was released the day after and received largely positive reviews</p>
