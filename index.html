      <p class="card-text"><h1>About</h1><br>RollerCoaster Tycoon is a series of simulation video games about building and managing
        an amusement park. Each game in the series challenges players with open-ended amusement park management and
        development, and allowing players to construct and customize their own unique roller coasters and other thrill
        rides.

        The first game was created by Scottish programmer Chris Sawyer, with assistance from various leading figures from
        the real-world roller coaster and theme park industry.[1] The rest of the series contains three other main games,
        expansion packs, a number of ports, and a mobile installment. A refresh of the series, RollerCoaster Tycoon World,
        was released in November 2016, and followed up by RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures for Switch in 2018 and PC in
        2019.

        Licensing for the series is currently held by Atari SA, who renewed their deal with Chris Sawyer on October 11,
        2022
        for ten more years.</p>

      <p class="card-text">RollerCoaster Tycoon was released for Microsoft Windows on 22 March 1999. RollerCoaster
        Tycoon was later ported to the Xbox game console in 2003. The game was developed by Chris Sawyer and published
        by Hasbro Interactive under the MicroProse brand.

        RollerCoaster Tycoon received two expansion packs: Added Attractions (released in North America as Corkscrew
        Follies) in 1999, and Loopy Landscapes in 2000. Two special editions were released: RollerCoaster Tycoon
        Gold/Totally RollerCoaster in 2002, which contained the original game, Corkscrew Follies, and Loopy Landscapes;
        and RollerCoaster Tycoon Deluxe in 2003, which contained the content in Gold plus more designs for the different
        customizable rides.

        A port for the Xbox was released on 23 March 2003, handled by Frontier Developments and published by Infogrames
        Interactive. This version featured both expansion packs as well.</p>
